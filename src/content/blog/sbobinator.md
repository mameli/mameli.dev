When OpenAI released its API, I wondered: "Is it truly groundbreaking to build a service with GPT-4?" To answer this, I decided to build something practical. That's how Sbobinator was born. It's a tool that makes transcribing audio easy and provides short summaries.

Here are the main points:

- Using the API is straightforward.
- The instructions are complete and easy to understand.
- For common models, the cost is very low (for example, it cost me only 15 cents for the example shown here).

You can build an app like this in just a weekend. This makes it easier for anyone to create new products. However, it's still hard to handle sales, find customers, and come up with good service ideas.

So, my first question was answered: building things has become simpler. The technology is ready and easy to use. But there are still big challenges, especially in getting people to know about your product and buy it. This project was mainly a test for a LinkedIn post, and it makes me think about what to do next.
