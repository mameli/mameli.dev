# Prompt Engineering Lessons

Lessons Learned from Google's Guide

In this blog post, I explore the key takeaways from Google's guide on prompt engineering. The guide provides valuable insights into how to craft effective prompts for large language models (LLMs).

## Key Takeaways

1. **Be Specific**: The more specific your prompt, the better the output.
2. **Use Examples**: Providing examples can help the model understand the context better.
3. **Iterate**: Don't be afraid to iterate on your prompts to get the desired output.

## Conclusion

Prompt engineering is an essential skill for anyone working with LLMs. By following these guidelines, you can significantly improve the quality of the outputs generated by these models.
